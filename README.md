## How to Contribute

NaturalAgents is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone! There are many ways to be involved:

1. Code contributions - help us develop new macros, frontend interfaces, and backend infrastructure for executing agentic workflows
2. Usability research/design - ideate best possible features and UI/UX organizations with us (we want this software to be as usable/inuitive as possible)
3. Feedback and testing - let us know what is working well, what could be improved, and what you'd like to see

## 💪 Motivation

We're making it easy for anyone to build Agents and custom workflows with AI using just plain english. We aim to democratize the power of agents to everyone
