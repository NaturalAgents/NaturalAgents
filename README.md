## How to Contribute

NaturalAgents is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone! There are many ways to be involved:

1. Code contributions - help us develop new macros, frontend interfaces, and backend infrastructure for executing agentic workflows
2. Usability research/design - ideate best possible features and UI/UX organizations with us (we want this software to be as usable/inuitive as possible)
3. Feedback and testing - let us know what is working well, what could be improved, and what you'd like to see

## ðŸ’ª Motivation

We're making it easy for anyone to build Agents and custom workflows with AI using just plain english. We aim to democratize the power of agents to everyone

## Updates

- Oct 11, 2024 - save and recall recipe files for later
- Oct 9, 2024 - added summarization macro
- Oct 6, 2024 - MVP editor; includes prompting and image generation macros

## Upcoming Roadmap

- **Create more diverse macros:** `search the web`, `text to audio`, `repeat`
- **Include inputs:** `user inputs`, `PDFs`, `images`, `audio`, `postgres database`
- **Better agent communication -** explore most usuable editor rules to chain agent responses together
