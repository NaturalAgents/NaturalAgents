<Steps>
### Adding more diverse macros
 
A few planned at the moment are 
- `search the web`: find information from search results
- `text to audio`: convert text to audio
- `repeat` : repeat parts of agent logic
-  `structured output`: generate jsons with user defined fields
 
### Add richer user inputs
 
Some include
- `images`
- `audio files`
- `postgres database`

### Versioning

Ability to inspect previous runs and recipe version

### Hosted solution

Make NaturalAgents available online as a hosted solution. This would allow people who have no coding experience to also use the tool.
