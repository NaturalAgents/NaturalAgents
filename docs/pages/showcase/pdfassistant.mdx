Here we use three macros `Add PDF`, `user input` and `generate`.

`Add PDF` displays a button which the user can use to upload a PDF. The macro will automatically handle the uploading and extract all the text inside the PDF.

`user input` displays a text area where the user can specify their question. Note that we specified the instructions for the text area when creating the recipe.

`generate` is used to ask an LLM to answer the user's question about the PDF. Since it is nested underneath `Add PDF` and `user input`, it has access to both the PDF's text and the user's question. All of this gets passed as context, which the LLM uses to answer the user's question.
