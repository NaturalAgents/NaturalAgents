# Passing

Powerful workflows can be built when multiple macros are put together. Macros follow the "waterfall" rule.

## Combining macro rules

Macros are combined using indents. The first macro is considered the start of a "Block". Every indented macro will use all of the data that has appear thus far in its Block, hence a "waterfall". For example, consider the following recipe.

<Image
  src={`${prefix}/learn/chainedmacro.png`}
  alt="Create recipe image"
  width={1000}
  height={500}
/>

For the sake of simplicity, a text description of this recipe looks like the following

```
<generate macro 1>: write a 500 word essay about dogs
    <generate macro 2>: summarize the essay, prioritize quality or quantity
```

This is a description of how inputs and outputs were handled

- First we run `<generate macro 1>`

  - inputs: []
  - instruction: write a 500 word essay about dogs
  - output: "essay from llm"

- Then we run `<generate macro 2>`
  - inputs: [write a 500 word essay about dogs, "essay from lmm"]
  - instruction: summarize the essay, prioritize quality or quantity
  - output: "summarized essay"

Note that `<generate macro 2>` has context of everything that occured in `<generate macro 1>`. All the inputs and outputs thus far become context for the next macro in the waterfall.

## Results

When we run the example recipe, we get the following outputs

<div className="flex gap-4 flex-wrap">
  <div className="w-full text-center">
    <Image
      src={`${prefix}/learn/essay.png`}
      alt="Create recipe image"
      width={1000}
      height={500}
      className="object-contain"
    />
    <p className="mt-2">500 word essay (generate macro 1 output)</p>
  </div>
  <div className="w-full text-center">
    <Image
      src={`${prefix}/learn/summary.png`}
      alt="Create recipe image"
      width={1000}
      height={500}
      className="object-contain"
    />
    <p className="mt-2">Essay summary (generate macro 2 output)</p>
  </div>
</div>
