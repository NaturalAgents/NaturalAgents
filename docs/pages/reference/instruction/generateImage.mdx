# Generate Image

Description: generates an image from a description.

- `Input`: None.
- `Instruction`: This is a description for the type of image to generate.
- `Output`: The output is the generated image. This appears in the results pane by default.

## Usage tips

This is best used as a standalone macro. You can nest is underneath other macros, but it will behave independently.

<Image
