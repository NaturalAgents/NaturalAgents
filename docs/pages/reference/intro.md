# Introduction

This is a catalog for all the available macros in NaturalAgents. It will cover their abilities, and potential use cases. Macros generally have the following structure

- `Inputs`: Set of inputs that are passed to the macro
- `Instruction`: Instructions you can assign to the macro in the recipe creation. This controls its behavior.
- `Output`: Cacro will create an output when its run

There are two categories of macros

- `Inputs`: When the recipe is running, these macros will ask the user for inputs (pdf, text, etc)
- `Outputs`: When the recipe is running, these macros product outputs that will be visible in the results pane. There are additional settings to control whether the final output is produced.
